# Mirai Laboratory

We modified the original Mirai source code and updated the needed dependencies to run it in a local environment through Docker. This repository provides everything you need to run Mirai without any changes necessary. 

Given that everything runs in Docker, you can run this on any operating system that supports Docker, thus for your information, the laboratory was performed on a Virtual Machine running Lubuntu 20.04.

I will not provide any further information in this README, as all the information you need can be found in the [Report](/resources/report.pdf) file (section 4 to run it) and the [Presentation](/resources/malware-IoT-presentation.pdf) file.

> **&#9432;** The **original README** file can be found [here](/resources/OLD-README.md), in case you want to try to run Mirai without Docker (although I would recommend cloning the original repository since some chances were made here). Additionally, a **copy** of the original thread on HackForums can be found [here](/resources/OLD-HackForums-Thread.md).
